This is a Forge mod adding a simple absorption mechanic to Minecraft. Absorption will heal over time, and The number of absorption hearts a player gets is based on a few configurable factors, including:

* A base amount of absorption granted to all players 
* Whether the player is wearing golden armor
* Enchantments of the armor
* An opton to entirely replace armor with absorption hearts.
